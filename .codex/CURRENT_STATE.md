# Codex Current State

Updated: 2026-07-10 (Asia/Shanghai)

## Repository State

- Current goal: checkpoint and publish the verified provider credential redaction fix.
- Current branch: `codex/sol-autonomous-hardening`
- Current HEAD commit: `bb26c6dece18d0e0e3fd67d761f18b5a14f9cf6c`
- Last known stable commit: `bb26c6dece18d0e0e3fd67d761f18b5a14f9cf6c` (`make check` passed; local security commit)
- Active task: closeout for completed task `ARA-008` in `.codex/TASK_QUEUE.md`
- Uncommitted changes: yes; only maintenance-state closeout files remain after the validated security commit.

## Modified Files

- `.codex/CURRENT_STATE.md`
- `.codex/TASK_QUEUE.md`
- `.codex/COMPLETED.md`
- `.codex/DECISIONS.md`
- `.codex/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`
- `.codex/LAST_VALIDATION.json`
- `.codex/RESUME_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

## Completed Steps

- Confirmed repository root, branch, remotes, recent history, upstream, and ahead/behind state.
- Fetched `origin`; `master` matched `origin/master` at `a94c4e2` before branching.
- Confirmed there is no active merge, rebase, cherry-pick, revert, sequencer, or stash.
- Identified a stale invalid `.git/REBASE_HEAD` file; no active rebase directories exist, so it was left untouched.
- Created `codex/sol-autonomous-hardening` from the synchronized `master` head.
- Reviewed the tracked workflow, CI, packaging, release, test, and maintenance documentation.
- Classified ignored project runs, logs, local configuration, and research artifacts as out of scope for cleanup or commit.
- Ran the current canonical baseline: `make check` passed with 137 tests and 43 subtests.
- Reproduced the single-path compare CLI mismatch with exit code 0 and `run_count: 1`.
- Added a regression test that failed before the fix and passed after it.
- Added CLI-boundary validation while preserving the single-run internal helper behavior.
- Verified the two-or-more path with a three-path parser test and a two-path CLI smoke.
- Committed recovery state as `a1fec51` and the compare-runs fix as `033ed01`.
- Pushed `codex/sol-autonomous-hardening` and verified the remote SHA matches local HEAD.
- Opened draft PR 13 for continued maintenance checkpoints.
- Reproduced exact-key leakage in provider events and formatted exception tracebacks.
- Added failing regression coverage for explicit and custom-environment credentials.
- Redacted known configured secrets before event persistence and before constructing displayed exception chains.
- Committed the credential-redaction fix as `bb26c6d`.

## Remaining Steps

- Commit the state closeout, push both local commits, update draft PR 13, and verify the remote SHA.

## Test Status

- Current branch validation: `make check` passed at 2026-07-10T16:27:39+08:00.
- Results: Ruff format passed (50 files), Ruff lint passed, import smoke passed, pytest passed (`139 passed, 43 subtests passed`).
- Compare-runs targeted validation: module suite passed (`7 passed`).
- Single-path CLI reproduction after the fix: rejected with exit code 2 and the expected argument error.
- Two-path CLI smoke after the fix: exit code 0 and `run_count: 2`.
- GitHub sync: local and remote `033ed01638965d873a08da05d3ad02dc3529b162` match; PR 13 is draft.
- Credential-redaction targeted suite: `tests/test_llm.py` passed (`11 passed`).
- Full regression after the security fix: `make check` passed (`141 passed, 43 subtests passed`).
- `git diff --check` passed.
- Provider-backed tests: not planned for this checkpoint; no paid or network model calls are needed.

## Recent Failed Command

- `git show --no-patch --format='%H %P %s' REBASE_HEAD` failed with `fatal: bad object REBASE_HEAD` because the stale file references an unavailable object. This is not an active Git operation.
- The first unproxied push hung without output and was interrupted safely; the command-scoped proxy retry succeeded.
- One post-push GitHub API verification hit a TLS handshake timeout; scoped `git ls-remote` independently verified the exact remote SHA.

## Next Command

```bash
git status --short --branch
```

## Interruption Recovery

Read `.codex/RESUME_INSTRUCTIONS.md`, then compare this file with `git status --short --branch` and `git log --oneline -n 10`. Do not touch ignored runtime artifacts or the local `config.yaml`.

## Current Risks And Prohibitions

- Do not delete or rewrite ignored experiment artifacts, local logs, or private configuration.
- Do not remove the stale `.git/REBASE_HEAD` without an explicit cleanup decision; it is harmless while no rebase directory exists.
- Do not run paid-provider workflows without credential presence checks, a dry run, and an explicit cost cap.
- Do not change prompts, scoring semantics, provider behavior, benchmark results, or artifact interpretation as part of a maintenance-only fix.
- Do not stage with `git add -A`; stage only reviewed paths.
